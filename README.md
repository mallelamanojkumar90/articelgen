# CrewAI Article Generation Workflow

This project implements a multi-agent workflow using CrewAI to generate, review, and publish articles. The workflow consists of four agents:

1. **Researcher Agent**: Gathers information on a given topic.
2. **Creator Agent**: Writes an article based on the research.
3. **Reviewer Agent**: Reviews and edits the article.
4. **Publisher Agent**: Publishes the final article as a Markdown (.md) file.

## Next Steps
- Install CrewAI and dependencies
- Implement each agent
- Orchestrate the workflow
